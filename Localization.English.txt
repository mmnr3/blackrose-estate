EventStart.text,You enter the estate through the main entrance. The hall was once lavishly decorated but now most of the furniture has its color faded and the wooden part is scuffed and bruised. “I was never allowed to enter through this door, only the servants door. My uncle was very strict” Viktor exclaims. “But you are no longer here” he says as he deliberately knocks over an old photo of the man.

EventStartViktorPainting.text,Viktor goes up and stands before a big painting of his uncle. You put down your lugade and look around.
EventStartGreta.text,Greta walks in and when Viktor sees her he lights up and runs over and gives her a big hug. “Greta! How good it is to see you again, it has been too long” he says happily, releasing the woman from his embrace. “Goodness grace Viktor, you have grown. And still not respecting you uncle I see.” she says glancing at the overturned photo. Viktor laughs and turns to you. “Friends, this is Greta the housekeeper. She was like a mother to me when I grew up.” He introduces you to her with great enthusiasm. “Well” Greta says, “You are a bit early, I have not lunch ready for you. But there is a bar in the lounge if you want to have a drink before dinner. If you excuse me, I will go get things ready”. Greta quickly leaves for the kitchen.
