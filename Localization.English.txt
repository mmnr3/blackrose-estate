EventStartGreta.text,A door opens and a woman walks in. When Duncan sees her he lights up and runs over and gives her a big hug. “Greta! How good it is to see you again, it has been too long” he says happily, releasing the woman from his embrace. “Goodness grace Duncan, you certainly have not changed. ” Duncan laughs and turns to you. “Friends, this is Greta the housekeeper. She was like a mother to me when I grew up.” He introduces you to her with great enthusiasm. “Well” Greta says, “You are a bit early, the dinner is not ready. But there is a bar in the lounge if you want to have a drink before dinner and relax. The guest rooms are upstairs. You have to take the luggage yourself, William would do it but I’m afraid he is a bit under the weather of late. Now, If you excuse me, I will go get things ready”. Greta quickly leaves for the kitchen.

He took the family name blackrose after the black roses that started to grow around the mine. Everytime a new family member took over the business there was a big accident, killing a lot of people and then they found a new rich vein. Almost like it was connected.”\nDuncan downs the drink and pours himself another.\n"

Greta was like a mother to me but always had a hint of sadness in her eyes. Like she knew something bad was going to happen to me. After a while I started to notice strange things around the house."|||
